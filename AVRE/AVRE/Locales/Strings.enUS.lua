It draws a circular marker under players in range, and can optionally draw a line to those players as well. Finally, a circle outline can optionally be drawn around you, assisting you in knowing when you're approaching range of other players.\n\nYou can see how AVR range checks work by creating a range check scene yourself using AVR.
