Example videos

These are some examples of what AVR+AVRE can do. Graphics to some mechanics may have been altered since these videos were taken. All mechanics are configurable in terms of color, transparency, and sometimes circle radius.

Putricide (Unbound Plague): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YRxQx6Rsls

The "Help me in" countdown is created by Plagued.

Putricide (Malleable Goo): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHrRWuUsIEI

Sindragosa (Instability and Frost Beacon): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FDwPeBdLQg

The positioning markers on the ground were created by our raid leader before the fight, not by AVRE.

The UI used in these videos is available for download here.
